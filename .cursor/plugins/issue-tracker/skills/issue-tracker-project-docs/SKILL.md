# Issue Tracker — Project supporting docs

Author or revise **one** Project supporting document per run and point
`supportingDocs` at it. Docs are consult-if-present for plan/work agents;
this skill only creates or revises them. Glossary and field shape:
[SPEC.md § Project supporting docs](../../SPEC.md#project-supporting-docs).

Use the `issue` binary. Do not set `ISSUES_DIR`. Never retarget `npm link` to
`/root/.cursor/plugins/local/...`. Cross-cutting CLI invariants:
[SPEC.md § CLI invariants](../../SPEC.md#cli-invariants).

## Argument

Optional: a **Project** id and/or a doc key
(`vision` | `codingStandards` | `designSystem`).

## Flow

### 1. Resolve Project

- If a Project id was given, use it.
- Otherwise resolve from context (`issue summary <id>` → `Project:` line) or
  ask: `issue tree` (no-arg), then pick among `project <id>` lines (one → use
  it; many → ask which; none → stop).
- Confirm with `issue project view <projectId>` (or `issue summary
  <projectId>`). Take `<projectId>` from the id token on
  `Project: <projectId> — <title>`. Note the `Workspace:` /
  `workspace:` line when present (needed only if location is workspace —
  gated in step 3).
- Read current pointers once and keep the JSON for this run:
  `issue project get <projectId> supportingDocs` (empty when unset).

### 2. Select doc key

If the user did not name a key, **prompt** for exactly one of:

| key | label |
| --- | --- |
| `vision` | Vision |
| `codingStandards` | Coding standards |
| `designSystem` | Design system |

Do not invent other keys. One key per run.

**Revise vs create.** From the step-1 JSON: this run is **revising** when
`supportingDocs[<key>]` is present; otherwise it is **creating**. Use that
fork in steps 3–4 (do not re-derive it).

If revising and the existing ref is already `type: "workspace"`, you may
apply the Workspace gate in step 3 early (same stop-and-hand-back rule).

### 3. Choose location

Ask **every run** whether to store as a Project **attachment** or a
**workspace** file (relative to Project `workspace`).

Defaults:

- **Revising** → keep the existing location type and path/basename unless
  the user picks a different one.
- **Creating** → prefer **attachment** with the well-known basename for
  that key:

  | key | basename |
  | --- | --- |
  | `vision` | `vision.md` |
  | `codingStandards` | `coding-standards.md` |
  | `designSystem` | `design-system.md` |

For a new workspace path, ask for a workspace-relative path (no absolute
paths, no `..`).

**Workspace gate.** After the user selects or keeps **workspace** storage:
if the Project has no `Workspace:` / `workspace:` line, **stop and hand
back to the user** to set it
(`issue project set <projectId> workspace <path>`) before continuing — no
fallback (SPEC § Project workspace). Attachment storage does not require a
workspace.

### 4. Load current content (revise only)

When **revising**, load from the existing ref in the step-1 JSON:

- **attachment** — `issue project view <projectId>` and Read the **absolute**
  on-disk path printed in the Attachments section
  (`<name> (<n> bytes) — <absolute-path>`). Do not assemble a relative
  `issues/...` path from cwd.
- **workspace** — Read `<Workspace:>/<path>` (join only under Project
  workspace).

If the target is missing or unreadable, tell the user and continue as a
fresh draft for that key (still write + set at the end).

### 5. Grill (`/grill-me`)

Invoke **`/grill-me`** for **this doc only**: goals and content the user wants
captured. Goal-only freeform — **no fixed outline** and no obligatory section
checklist. Stay on the chosen doc; do not grill the other two keys.

Do not write files or set `supportingDocs` until after draft approval (step 6).

### 6. Draft and approve

Draft the full document in chat (Markdown unless the user asked for HTML).
Get an **explicit user approve** of the draft before writing. On rejection,
revise the draft and re-approve — do not write yet.

### 7. Write

**Attachment**

1. If replacing an existing attachment basename (same name already attached,
   or switching content onto a basename that is already present), first
   `issue project detach <projectId> <name>`.
2. Write the approved draft to a temp file whose basename is the chosen
   name, then:
   `issue project attach <projectId> <temp-file>`
3. Use the printed stored basename as `<name>` for step 8 (attach may rename
   on collision — prefer detach-first so the well-known name sticks).

**Workspace**

1. Create or overwrite the file under Project `Workspace:` at the chosen
   relative path (create parent dirs if needed).
2. **Do not** `git add`, `git commit`, or otherwise stage/commit.
3. **Remind the user** that the workspace file will **not** be committed
   automatically — they must commit it themselves if they want it in git.

### 8. Record `supportingDocs`

```bash
# attachment
issue project set <projectId> supportingDocs --doc <key> --attachment <name>

# workspace
issue project set <projectId> supportingDocs --doc <key> --workspace <path>
```

`<path>` is workspace-relative. The file or attachment must already exist
(step 7) — set-time must-exist checks apply.

### 9. Stop

Stop after one doc. Do **not** auto-chain into the other supporting docs.
Offer to run again for another key only if the user asks.

## Notes

- Clearing a key or the whole field is out of band:
  `issue project set <id> supportingDocs --clear [--doc <key>]` — only if the
  user explicitly asks.
- Do not hand-edit `issue.json`. Do not put supporting-doc bodies into
  Project `description.md`.

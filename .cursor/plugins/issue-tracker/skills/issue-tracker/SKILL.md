# Issue Tracker

A local work tracker (dark shadcn/ui web app) that replaces the giant "plan"
doc: an agent authors a spec into a **Project > Epic > Story > Task** tree
that maps directly onto git stacked PRs, then works the tree while a human
watches live in the browser. A **Project** is the top-level container (an
organizational grouping of Epics); a directory per issue on disk is the
source of truth; the CLI (for agents) and HTTP/SSE (for the UI) are thin
adapters over one validated service layer. Markdown specs, per-issue chat,
and derived blocked/status state live in that UI.

Read [SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md) for the full glossary (Kinds, relationships,
derived state) and design rationale.

## Start the dev server

```bash
cd .cursor/plugins/issue-tracker/app && npm install && npm run dev
```

This starts:

- Vite dev server on http://localhost:8060 (frontend)
- Express API + SSE server on http://localhost:8061 (backend)

Tell the user the UI is available at http://localhost:8060.

## What it shows

- **Project sidebar** — a collapsible sidebar lists Projects; selecting one
  scopes the tree to that Project. Create/rename/delete Projects from the
  sidebar (deleting a Project cascades to all its Epics/Stories/Tasks).
- **Tree view** — collapsible Epic > Story > Task outline (scoped to the
  selected Project) with derived status badges, git/stack chips (branch,
  mergeBase, PR, merged, sha), Task `assignee` and Epic/Story/Task
  `needsAttention` badges, and blocked rows
  dimmed. Archived Epic / Story / Task rows are hidden by default; a "Show
  archived" toggle (client preference, next to search) reveals them. Row hover
  offers Archive / Unarchive (same cascade as CLI).
- **Detail** — the issue's `description.md` rendered as GFM (with `issue:`
  cross-links and relative links to that issue's `attachments/`), an edit form
  (Task `assignee`, Epic/Story/Task `needsAttention`, Task `status`, git facts),
  Archive / Unarchive in the header (Epic / Story / Task), attachment
  list/upload/download, a git/stack panel, Task `assignee` and Epic/Story/Task
  `needsAttention` badges (`attentionReason` when
  set), and (for Stories with `specReview` set) a spec-review chip (`passed` /
  `failed`; omitted when unset), (for Tasks with `noDiff` set) a no-diff chip
  (omitted when unset), and a per-issue chat.
- Changes to `issues/` on disk (from the CLI or by hand) appear live over SSE
  without a refresh.

## When to use it

Open this UI when a human wants to watch or steer an agent working a stack of
PRs. Agents themselves do **not** use this UI — they drive the CLI.

## Agent skills (pick by task)

- **`issue-tracker-authoring`** — author a standalone issue-tracker plan tree as
  one nested YAML doc and `apply` it; use when planning git PR stacks,
  Epic/Story/Task grain, multi-root splits, or turning a plan into tracked
  issues.
- **`issue-tracker-work`** — coordinate implementation of an Epic or
  project-level Story by spawning plugin subagents — do not implement yourself;
  use when implementing or working a tracker Epic/Story.
- **`issue-tracker-plan`** — grill an Idea, todo Epic, or not-started
  project-level Story into a plan tree via apply, then auto-chain polish and
  retro; use when planning an Idea, fleshing out a tracker plan, or running
  issue-tracker-plan.
- **`issue-tracker-plan-polish`** — polish an existing Epic or project-level
  Story plan tree with parallel check agents, then auto-apply when safe; use
  when polishing a plan, cleaning up a tracker tree, or running plan-polish.
- **`issue-tracker-project-docs`** — author or revise one Project supporting doc
  (vision, coding standards, or design system) and record it in
  `supportingDocs`; use when writing or updating project vision, coding
  standards, design system, or supporting docs.

# Issue Tracker — Plan (grill → plan tree)

Turn a rough capture into one or more detailed plan trees — each a
**project-level Story > Task** tree or an **Epic > Story > Task** tree, per
authoring Epic grain and [Multi-Epic split](../issue-tracker-authoring/SKILL.md#multi-epic-split).
You grill the user, show the outline, get one explicit-consequence yes, then
migrate via `issue apply` (issue-tracker-authoring), auto-chain
`issue-tracker-plan-polish` on every resulting root, then spawn
`issue-tracker-retro` per root after polish succeeds. Behavioral contract:
Epic **auto-plan-polish-confirm** invariants (single post-outline gate +
auto-chain polish) — do not restate that list here. Do not implement product
code; this skill only authors the plan artifact.

Use the `issue` binary. Do not set `ISSUES_DIR`. Never retarget `npm link` to
`/root/.cursor/plugins/local/...`. Cross-cutting CLI invariants:
[SPEC.md § CLI invariants](../../SPEC.md#cli-invariants).

Grain, multi-Epic split, apply doc shape, parent-prose, and prune-by-default
rules live in issue-tracker-authoring and [SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md) — when
proposing the tree(s), apply those rules yourself; only ask the user when a
product or dependency choice remains after those rules. Do not restate them
here. Reference authoring [Multi-Epic split](../issue-tracker-authoring/SKILL.md#multi-epic-split)
for when one capture becomes multiple roots; do not duplicate that rule text.

## Argument

An **Idea** id, an **Epic** id whose derived
`issue epic get <id> epicStatus` is `todo`, or a **project-level Story** id
whose derived `issue story get <id> storyStatus` is `not-started`.

If none is given:

1. Run `issue tree` (no-arg: all projects).
2. Resolve `<projectId>` from the `project <id>` lines (one → use it; many → ask which; none → stop).
3. Run `issue tree <projectId>`. Offer only **Ideas**, Epics whose status
   chip is `todo` (or confirm with `issue epic get <id> epicStatus`), and
   **project-level** Stories whose status chip is `not-started` (or confirm
   with `issue story get <id> storyStatus`; project-level = `partOf` is the
   Project). **Do not offer** `in-progress` / `done` Epics, or Stories at
   `in-progress` / `pr-open` / `merged` — they fail §Bootstrap gates.

Never bare `issue list`.

## Bootstrap

Before grilling:

1. `issue summary <id>` — confirm kind; read `Project:` and `Workspace:`.
   - Take `<projectId>` from the id token on `Project: <projectId> — <title>`.
   - If `Workspace:` is absent, **stop and hand back to the user** to set it
     (`issue project set <projectId> workspace <path>`) before continuing.
     Codebase lookup during the grill needs cwd = `Workspace:` — there is no
     plan-only fallback (SPEC § Project workspace: unset → escalate, never
     fall back).
2. **Read** the absolute path formed by joining `Workspace:` from step 1 with
   `.cursor/plugins/issue-tracker/agents/_issue-tracker-consult-supporting-doc.md`,
   then consult `vision` per that file using the step-1 summary output.
3. Kind / status gates:
   - **Idea** — proceed.
   - **Epic** — run `issue epic get <id> epicStatus`.
     - `todo` → proceed.
     - `in-progress` or `done` → **refuse** and stop. Tell the user this skill
       only rewrites pre-implementation Epics; for an existing tree use
       `issue-tracker-plan-polish` (or work it with `issue-tracker-work`).
   - **Story** — confirm it is **project-level** (`issue story get <id> partOf`
     equals `<projectId>` from step 1; refuse Epic-child Stories). Then run
     `issue story get <id> storyStatus`.
     - `not-started` → proceed.
     - `in-progress`, `pr-open`, or `merged` → **refuse** and stop. Tell the
       user this skill only rewrites not-started project-level Stories; for an
       existing tree use `issue-tracker-plan-polish` (or work it with
       `issue-tracker-work`).
   - Any other kind → refuse.
4. `issue <kind> view <id>` — load the full capture (`description.md`), not
   only the summary blurb (`idea`, `epic`, or `story` from step 3).
5. If the source is an **Epic** or **project-level Story**, also
   `issue tree <id>` so the existing subtree is in context before grilling.

## Grill-me protocol (inline)

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of the plan until you reach
a **shared understanding**. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving
dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your
recommended answer.

Do **not** ask the user to choose Story vs Task grain, Epic vs project-level
Story grain, or slice decomposition — apply issue-tracker-authoring grain
yourself. Reserve questions for product and dependency choices that remain
after those rules.

**Early confirm (multi-root).** Once themes are clear enough to apply
authoring [Multi-Epic split](../issue-tracker-authoring/SKILL.md#multi-epic-split),
propose the **root set** in chat: each theme as an Epic or project-level Story
(per Epic grain), plus any Epic `blockedBy` edges. Get agreement on that set
**before** drilling into each root's Stories/Tasks. If the capture stays a
single root, skip this beat and continue grilling that root.

**Rules (mandatory):**

- Ask **one question at a time**, waiting for feedback before continuing.
  Multiple questions at once is bewildering.
- Each question should be **succinct**.
- Recommended answers must **not** be part of the question text. Express them
  only via a `(recommended)` prefix in the **list of answers** (not inside the
  question).
- If a fact can be found by exploring the codebase (cwd = Project
  `Workspace:`), **look it up** rather than asking. Product and dependency
  decisions remain the user's — put each one to them and wait.
- **Do not enact** the plan (no `apply`, no tracker writes that materialize the
  tree) until the user answers yes at the single post-outline gate below.
- Do **not** ask a separate pre-outline “shared understanding?” confirm —
  when the grill is ready, go straight to the outline + gate.

This protocol is **inlined here**. Do **not** add or invoke a separate
plugin-local grill-me skill.

## Single post-outline gate, then migrate

When the grill is ready (no extra pre-outline confirm):

1. **Outline.** Show the proposed tree outline in chat with enough prose that
   the user can judge scope. Match the chosen migrate shape(s):
   - **Single root** — story-form → root Story title + Task titles; epic-form →
     Epic title + Story/Task hierarchy (implementation order).
   - **Multi-root** — list every resulting root (Epic or project-level Story),
     each with its Story/Task hierarchy and any `blockedBy` edges.
   Do **not** `apply` yet. The user may edit the outline in chat before
   answering the gate.
2. **One gate.** Ask **one** yes/no whose lead-in states that **yes** means:
   migrate the plan, run `issue-tracker-plan-polish` on every resulting root,
   auto-apply polish fixes, and spawn `issue-tracker-retro` per root after
   polish succeeds. No other confirm beats before migrate.
3. On **yes** → **Migrate** (below). On **no** → stop (do not migrate).

## Migrate

Never a project-form `apply` for this migration. Follow authoring for
apply-doc shape and prune-by-default scope. Choose **story-form** or
**epic-form** per root by issue-tracker-authoring **Epic grain** (do not
restate that rule here).

### Single root (not splitting)

One epic-form or story-form apply. Keep existing in-place / Idea-archive
behavior:

**Story-form** — `project: <projectId>` string + `story:` object (no `epic:`):

| Source | Story id in the doc | After successful `apply` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Idea** | Mint a **new** kebab id — **do not reuse the Idea id** | `issue idea set <ideaId> archived true` |
| **project-level Story** (`not-started`) | **Keep** the existing Story id | (none) |

**Epic-form** — `project: <projectId>` string + `epic:` object:

| Source | Epic id in the doc | After successful `apply` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Idea** | Mint a **new** kebab id — **do not reuse the Idea id** | `issue idea set <ideaId> archived true` |
| **Epic** (`todo`) | **Keep** the existing Epic id | (none) |
| **project-level Story** (`not-started`) | Mint a **new** kebab Epic id; **keep** the existing Story id as a child under that Epic | (none) |

Show `apply` stdout (and archive outcome on the Idea path). Report the
resulting Story or Epic id.

### Multi-root (splitting)

N separate epic-form / story-form applies — one per resulting root. Roots may
mix Epics and project-level Stories. **Always mint new root ids** (do not reuse
the source Idea / Epic / Story id as any new root id).

1. Apply in **`blockedBy` order** when deps exist among the new Epic roots;
   otherwise any order.
2. On **first apply failure:** stop. Leave already-written roots in place. Do
   **not** delete the source. No automatic rollback.
3. Only after **every** apply in the migrate succeeds: archive or delete the
   source — `issue idea set <ideaId> archived true`, `issue epic delete
   <epicId>` (source was `todo`), or `issue story delete <storyId>` (source
   was not-started project-level Story), as appropriate.

Show each `apply` stdout and the final archive/delete outcome. Report every
resulting root id.

## After success

For each resulting root in `blockedBy` order when deps exist among Epic
roots (otherwise any order):

1. Auto-chain **`issue-tracker-plan-polish`** on that root — no polish
   yes/no. Polish itself auto-applies when safe (see that skill); do not add
   an approve-before-apply beat here.
2. After that root's polish finishes its **success path** (retained apply
   landed, or no-changes-needed — including after the user resolves an
   escalate and apply proceeds), always spawn **Retro** (Spawn stubs) for
   that root. Do **not** check whether work-root `retro` is unset before
   spawning. Wait until the Cursor Task finishes (or raises needsAttention)
   — do not fire-and-forget. Do **not** mine transcripts yourself, and do
   **not** expect or relay a retro summary into your context.

Standalone `issue-tracker-plan-polish` does **not** spawn retro — only this
skill's After-success chain does.

## Spawn stubs

Pass these as the Cursor Task `prompt`. Inline the fields each stub lists.
Children own static behavior via their `agents/*.md` files — do not paste
workflow instructions here.

**Retro** — `subagent_type: issue-tracker-retro`
(`model: cursor-grok-4.5-high-fast`)

> Work root: `<rootId>` (`<title>`). Comment role: `retro`.

## Rules

- Tracker writes for the migration happen only after yes at the single
  post-outline gate.
- Do not edit workspace product source as part of planning (plan artifact /
  grill research reads only).
- Do not auto-start `issue-tracker-work`. After a successful migrate, always
  auto-chain polish then retro as in **After success** (no second yes/no).

# Issue Tracker — Author a Plan Tree

Authoring the tracker is producing a **plan artifact**, so it is permitted in
**Plan mode** (the tree is the plan). The tree is the **entire design** — it
must replace any prior plan doc and stand alone. Companion material belongs
**with the issue that uses it** (prose in `description.md`, or opaque files as
attachments — [SPEC.md § Attachments](../../SPEC.md#attachments)). Do not
hand-edit `issue.json`. Cross-cutting CLI invariants:
[SPEC.md § CLI invariants](../../SPEC.md#cli-invariants).

Localize prose to the tier where it belongs — don't dump the whole spec in the
Epic and leave children title-only, and don't enumerate in a parent the specific
work its children each cover
([SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md#parent-prose-must-not-restate-descendant-lists)).

## Author declaratively: one YAML doc, then `apply`

Write the **whole tree as a single nested YAML doc** and `apply` it — do not
build it up with imperative `issue <kind> add` calls and hand-threaded ids.

```bash
issue apply plan.yaml
```

Doc format and field seam: [SPEC.md § `apply` doc format](../../SPEC.md#apply-doc-format).

- **Structure at Project vs below Epic or project-level Story.** Under a
  Project, each `children:` entry declares `kind: epic | idea | story` so
  Epics, Ideas, and project-level Stories can interleave (shared sibling
  order). Below an Epic (or inside a project-level Story), kind comes from
  child keys (`stories` → `tasks`, and `stacked` for a Story that forks off
  another Story). `partOf` and `stackedOn` are inferred from the nesting,
  never written by hand.
- **Ids are author-chosen and stable.** Every node carries a required kebab `id`
  you pick (unique, slug-safe, title-independent). Because you choose them up
  front you can author `issue:<id>` cross-links and Epic-level `blockedBy` ids
  before anything exists — no create-order dependency, no id capture.
- **`blockedBy` is the only explicit cross-reference, and it lives on the
  Epic.** Containment (`partOf`) and the fork point (`stackedOn`) come from
  nesting; `blockedBy` is an **Epic-level** list of other same-Project Epic ids —
  the sole edge that crosses an Epic boundary. Model dependencies *within* an
  Epic as **stacks** (`stackedOn`), not `blockedBy`. When a unit needs code from
  two parallel Stories at once (a multi-parent / cross-stack dependency that a
  single fork point can't express), don't reach for a Story-level edge: split it
  into a **separate Epic that is `blockedBy` the first**, keeping Epics small
  (see the diamond in SPEC.md — keeps parallel stories parallel instead of
  linearizing them, at the cost of waiting for the blocking Epic to merge).
- **Re-apply as the plan evolves.** `apply` is an idempotent upsert that
  prunes-by-default: nodes you add appear, nodes you drop from the doc are
  deleted, and unchanged nodes are untouched. It is atomic (a doc that would
  break integrity changes nothing) and preserves runtime/progress fields and
  attachment bytes, so re-applying an edited doc mid-implementation is safe
  ([SPEC.md § Declarative/imperative field seam](../../SPEC.md#declarativeimperative-field-seam)).
  Re-`apply` the doc for plan-owned changes; do not patch plan-owned fields
  incrementally with `issue <kind> add` or kind `set`.
- **Scope the doc to a subtree.** Prune-by-default is bounded to the doc's root.
  To edit one epic or story without touching its siblings, root the doc there
  and reference the enclosing parents by id: an **epic form** (`project: <id>`
  string + `epic:` object) reconciles just that epic within the project, and a
  **story form** (`project: <id>` string + `story:` object; include `epic: <id>`
  only when the Story is under an Epic) reconciles that story and its tasks.
  Omit `epic` for a project-level Story (`partOf` the Project). Epic/story forms
  leave Ideas untouched (Ideas are Project children only). A story doc owns only
  its own tasks (stacked children belong to the Story's container — Epic or
  Project) and preserves the story's fork point.

## Epic grain: project-level Story vs Epic

Choose the top-level work root by shape, not habit:

- **Project-level Story** (`partOf` the Project, no Epic) — the plan is a
  **single Story plus its Tasks**. Author with Project `children:`
  `kind: story`, or story-form apply (`project:` + `story:`, no `epic:`).
- **Epic** — you need **sibling root Stories**, **stacking**, or Epic
  **`blockedBy`**. Overview + cross-cutting invariants only (not the full
  spec).

Stacking under a Project is integrity-legal (same-container rule), but
**authoring prefers an Epic whenever any stacking exists** — soft policy, not
an integrity error. Polish may warn on a lone single-Story Epic (suggest a
project-level Story) and on a project-level stack (suggest wrapping in an
Epic). Do not invent Story-level `blockedBy`; promote to an Epic when you need
cross-unit deps.

## Grain: Story vs Task

- **Project** — the top-level container that groups related Epics, Ideas, and
  project-level Stories. Organizational only (no status); its `description.md`
  is a short overview of the whole product area.
- **Epic** — overview + cross-cutting design principles/invariants only
  (what governs every phase). Not the full spec. When to choose an Epic vs a
  project-level Story: see
  [Epic grain](#epic-grain-project-level-story-vs-epic).
- **Story** = one PR / shippable unit: scope, approach, and any data-model or
  interface detail specific to it. May be `partOf` an Epic or the Project
  (project-level Story). Normally several tasks; one task's worth of work is a
  Task, not a Story.
- **Task** = one git commit: implementor-resolution detail (what to do + how to
  verify), no deeper than a good plan section. Must be a standalone vertical
  slice that leaves the tip buildable/testable ([SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md#kinds)).
  Tree nesting supplies context, so linking task → epic is unnecessary.
  **Tasks run in the order they appear in the doc** (top-to-bottom); authors
  never specify `order` — array position is implementation order.

**Each Story must be independently mergeable to `main`.** Stories merge to
`main` (stacked children after their fork-point Story, in stack order), and only
Stories merge — Tasks are internal steps that ship together as the Story's
one PR. So never split one cohesive change across Stories such that merging one
leaves `main` broken (e.g. a schema change in one Story and the code that
consumes it in another): keep it in a single Story as multiple Tasks. See the
stacked-PR merge model in [SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md).

### Task shape: vertical slices, not horizontal layers

Normative rule lives in [SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md#kinds) (Task kind + stacked-PR
merge model): each Task must leave the Story tip **buildable and testable**.

**Prefer** vertical slices — one thin end-to-end cut of a capability (types +
implementation + a focused test) that stands alone.

**Avoid** horizontal layering that does not stand alone:

- **Bad:** Task 1 adds types/interfaces only; Task 2 "wires them up"; Task 3
  adds tests — or a half-migration Task that does not compile. Early Tasks do
  not prove anything on their own.
- **Good:** Task 1 adds one complete capability (types, implementation, and a
  focused test) that builds; Task 2 adds the next capability the same way.

A plan's *phases* are the Story grain, its *todos/steps* the Task grain. Group
related todos into one Story and land them as tasks; when mapping todos to
Tasks, reshape horizontal layering into vertical slices (split or merge until
each Task stands alone as above). Split only a genuinely oversized phase. One
todo → one Story (a stack of one-task PRs with an empty Task tier) means you
split at the wrong tier.

## Task interface seams

Task descriptions that introduce or wire an interface must spell out **API
shape and field names** (function names/signatures, HTTP paths/methods,
multipart field name) so implementors do not invent them. Do not require file
or middleware homes — those are implementor choices, not authoring seams.

- **Bad:** "Add HTTP download for attachments" (implementor invents
  `getAttachment`, multer, and multipart field `"file"`).
- **Good:** "Add `GET /attachments/:id` returning the raw bytes; upload is
  `POST /attachments` multipart field `attachment`."

## Task Change paths

When a Task Change **does** name a file path, that path MUST be relative to
the Project `workspace` root. Do not use plugin-root shorthand (`agents/...`,
`skills/...`, `app/...`) — Read/Glob resolve those paths as
`<workspace>/agents/...` and miss the plugin tree.

- **Bad:** `In agents/issue-tracker-spec-conformance-validator.md`
- **Good:** `In
  .cursor/plugins/issue-tracker/agents/issue-tracker-spec-conformance-validator.md`

## Prior-content consistency

When a Task Change updates content, you must update every place that still
describes or depends on the prior version of that content so it stays
consistent with the new version.

## Completeness pass

Before done:

- Every part of the source design is represented.
- Companion material follows [SPEC.md § Attachments](../../SPEC.md#attachments)
  (no external workspace paths).
- **Epic grain** — single-Story plans use a project-level Story; Epics are for
  sibling roots, stacking, or `blockedBy` (see
  [Epic grain](#epic-grain-project-level-story-vs-epic)).
- No Story/Task is title-only; no Story holds just one task and the
  Story count isn't merely the bullet count.
- **Parent/child prose boundaries** — follow the localize guidance above
  ([SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md#parent-prose-must-not-restate-descendant-lists)):
  Epic holds no phase- or task-level detail that belongs in children; no
  Project/Epic/Story restates its children's per-unit list.
- Every Task that introduces or wires an interface spells out API shape and
  field names (see [Task interface seams](#task-interface-seams)).
- Every Task Change that names file paths uses workspace-relative paths (see
  [Task Change paths](#task-change-paths)).
- Every Task Change that updates content also updates every place that still
  describes or depends on the prior version (see
  [Prior-content consistency](#prior-content-consistency)).
